Dotfiles
========

These repository contains the dotfiles for a FreeBSD install on a new laptop.
This is the first time I've run a desktop system on anything but macOS since
around 2007 (though that was a mixture of FreeBSD and APT-flavoured Linux
distributions).

Packages
--------

- u2f-devd
- awesome
- picom
- musicpd
- srandrd
- nvim
- firefox
